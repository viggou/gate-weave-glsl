# Gate Weave effect glsl shader

This is an OpenGL/Matchbox Shader that emulates analog gate weave. "Gate weave" refers to how the image vibrates/wobbles a little due to the mechanics of the film being pulled through the motor in oldschool film cameras.

Mainly written for Baselight, but should work with other Matchbox compatible hosts.

## Installation (Baselight)

1. Clone or download the repo

`git clone https://github.com/viggou/gateweave-glsl.git`

2. Move both the .glsl and .xml files to your "shaders" folder

Linux:

`/usr/fl/shaders`

macOS:

`/Library/Application Support/FilmLight/shaders`
